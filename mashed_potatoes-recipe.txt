Ingredients:
 - 2 3/4 lbs. yellow-fleshed potatoes, peeled and quartered
 - 4 large garlic cloves, sliced
 - 3/4 cup milk
 - 2 Tbsp. butter
 - 100 grams aged Gouda cheese, grated
 - 2 green onions
 - salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
 1. Place the potatoes and garlic in a pot and cover with 2" of cold water.
 Gently boil the potatoes until tender. When cooked, drain the potatoes well,
 ensuring the garlic stays in the pot, and then thoroughly mash. Whip in the
 milk and butter until well combined. Mix in the cheese and green onions,
 season with salt and pepper, and serve.
